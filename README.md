============
A web application built primarily in JQuery that interfaces with the [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/) to create a student/teacher academic planner for students with ADHD. Created as part of the SS12 2013 Hackathon.

###The Prompt
> Students with ADHD often require assistance with academic planning. This project seeks to develop a Google Calendar based tool that allows teachers and students to plan a homework project schedule together. The teacher would have a master calendar interface to create templated project event and define some number of milestones which the application could evenly layout between the beginning and the deadline. The student would be able to post progress on each milestone, which the teacher could then check off. Teachers and students would be in synch about project expectations and corrective actions could be taken if appropriate progress is not made â€“ before the deadline.
